# Aaron Lee's Portfolio

**Built with Next.js, React Three Fiber, and Google Antigravity AI Workflows.**

## Project Overview

This portfolio explores "Context Engineering" by combining a high-fidelity 3D aesthetic with a clean, professional narrative. It showcases a "Hybrid" design philosophy where interactive 3D elements overlay high-quality static artwork.

## Key Features

### 🎮 Hybrid 3D Scene

- **Static Backbone**: High-contrast, Vaporwave-inspired background art.
- **Interactive Overlay**: A 3D spaceship and infinite road rendered with React Three Fiber.
- **Hidden by Default**: The 3D scene is an easter egg! **Press 'X'** on your keyboard to toggle it on.

This project was architected and built using an **Agentic Workflow**:

- **Architect**: Google Antigravity AI Agent (Gemini 3 Pro).
- **Context Engineer**: Aaron Lee.

## Tech Stack
